# enterprise
First real project in programming, with java.

ItÂ´s goal is to manage multiple entertainments like books, series and the like and 
give the possibility to download available parts from the internet.

For now it is on ice in favor of the android version [Enterprise App](https://github.com/mytlogos/enterprise-app) and the web-app (depeveloped in the same repository as the server) [Enterprise Lister (Server)](https://github.com/mytlogos/enterprise-lister).
The desktop application does not make much sense, as it has internet access 24/7, in comparison to smartphones, as long as one does not have a Internet Flat.
